This project provides a basic implementation of number operations in custom base systems. It allows the user to input two numbers in different bases (up to base 16) and perform arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication on them. The program also finds the maximum value among the given numbers, results of operations, and displays the results in the selected base.

The solution is split into Three main components:

Ex1.java: Contains helper methods for performing number conversions and validations in different bases.
Ex1Test.java: Tests the functions in Ex1
Ex1Main.java: The main program that allows the user to interact with the system by entering numbers, choosing a base, and performing operations.
